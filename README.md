# üåç Terra: Greener Framework for the Web

Terra is a fresh approach to building scalable and efficient web applications that prioritize reducing the environmental impact of websites, web apps, and e-commerce platforms. Terra aims to reduce carbon emissions by integrating modern technology and innovative solutions while providing a seamless development experience.

## Why Terra?

Virtually everything has a carbon footprint, even the internet, and every byte of data transferred consumes energy. Terra is here to help reduce that footprint by providing a solution that optimizes the development and performance of web applications.

## Features

- **Vite-Powered Development**: A seamless development experience means you spend less time on the computer, reducing overall carbon emissions.

- **Edge-Ready with Hono**: Delivering your content from the edge ensures faster response times and lower energy consumption.

- **Partial Hydration (Islands Architecture)**: Updating only what's necessary ensures utmost efficiency, saving energy and boosting performance.

- **Minimal Learning Curve**: Seamlessly integrates with frameworks you already know and love, like React and Vue, so you can be immediately operative.
