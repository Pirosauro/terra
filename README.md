# Terra - A Meta Framework with Islands Architecture

Welcome to the Terra project, a modern approach to building scalable and efficient web applications using the islands architecture. This project leverages the power of Hono, a lightning-fast framework for the edge, and Vite, a modern frontend build tool, to deliver a seamless development experience.

## Features

- **Islands Architecture**: reach highest performance by loading interactive components independently.
- **Vite**: for a fast development experience and optimized production builds.
- **Hono**: leverage on edge computing capabilities for near-instantaneous global response times.
- **Framework Indipendent**: natively integrate with various front-end frameworks, like React or Vue.

## Wrappers

- **React**: ready-to-use.
- **Preact**: work in progress.
- **Vue**: planned.
